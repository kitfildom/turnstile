# Turnstile REV42
This turnstile is the version REV42, the successor to REV21. This turnstile features an all-new operating system, a lot of new features, custom system messages, improved emergency handling, custom actions, updated licensing information, international release, full user-made application and addon support, automatic robot staff, and much, much more.

This turnstile does **NOT** grant ANY fees for ANY reason. The only fee you WILL pay is the one when you purchase the turnstile. This is, why REV42 is the most used international turnstile in history. Its successor, REV84 & REV84 PRO are much better, though, and this turnstile (referring to REV42) will be **deprecated by 20.01.1997 (DD.MM.YYYY)**. It is not recommended for use after this date, as many of the funcions will fail, until its **complete defunction by 01.01.2000 (DD.MM.YYYY)**. As a great alternative, we recommend LLPL98 TITAN, as it has the same, if not more functions.
