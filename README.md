# Turnstile
To proceed with your purchase, please pass through the turnstile on the lefthand side of you, and pay 250 dollards in cash. Once the transaction is complete, you will obtain a card, using which you will be able to enter, exit, or perform certain actions inside the whole area for 2 hours (125$ = 1 hour). **Before** your timer runs out, you shall return your card to the turnstile in the visitor centre. Before leaving, you will be asked to list every actions you performed within this area (25km, circular shape) and you will be requested to pay for these afterwards. If no actions were performed, you will be granted a 20$ fee. Before leaving, you will also be granted 5$ as a leaving fee, and for exiting the parking lot you will be granted 100$ for **every** hour your car has spent in the parking lot.
